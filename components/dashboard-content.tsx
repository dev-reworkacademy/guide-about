              As Guide began to take shape, the team reached out to universities
              worldwide. They aimed to create a diverse and comprehensive
              database of institutions, from prestigious Ivy League schools to
              emerging institutions in developing countries. They emphasized the
              benefits of joining Guide for universities, such as increased
              visibility and the ability to attract a diverse pool of
              applicants.

            <p className="[margin-block-start:0] [margin-block-end:12px] font-light">
              Many universities were initially skeptical but were eventually won
              over by Guideâ€™s potential to streamline the admissions process and
              reach a broader audience. They saw Guide as a way to connect with
              students who might not have had access to their programs
              otherwise. As partnerships grew, EduLink's database expanded,
              offering students an unprecedented range of options.
